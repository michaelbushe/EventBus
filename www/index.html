<h2>EventBus News</h2>
<ul>
   <li>
   <i>14-Dec-2009</i>&nbsp;The EventBus has a new home:<a href="http://www.eventbus.org">EventBus.org</a>.  EventBus 2.0 will be repackaged from org.bushe.eventbus
   to org.eventbus.  EventBus 2.0 will push the EventBus' utility into new environments, such as AJAX.
   </li>
   <li>
   <i>14-Dec-2009</i>&nbsp;<b>Site is in transition, releasing coming very soon.  Check back later today.</b>EventBus 1.4 Released. EventBus 1.4 adds:
      <ul>
         <li>Runtime Subscriber annotation for dynamic subscriptions, thanks to Mario Aquino from Limewire for the help.  A good use case for a dynamic description is 
             a chat client.  The chat window will not know who's messages to subscribe to until runtime.</li>
         <li>PublicationStatus added so that code can tell if an event was vetoed, published, is being processed, etc.</li>
         <li>ContainerEventServiceRegistrar called updateContainerEventService too often.</a></li>
         <li>Added AnnotationProcessor.unprocess(this).</a></li>
      </ul>
   <i>31-May-2009</i>&nbsp;EventBus 1.3 Released. EventBus 1.3 adds:
      <ul>
         <li>The ability to control the order in which subscribers are called with the Priority interface
            and priority annotation parameters.
         </li>
         <li>Support for annotated inner classes and other non-public members.</li>
         <li>Migrated to Maven2 POM from Ant.  A request has been to to synchronize EventBus releases to the Maven Central Repository.  It should be there very soon.  
         	If you just can't wait, it's also available <a href="http://www.bushe.com:8081/nexus/content/repositories/Bushe.orgSyncToCentral">here</a></li>
      </ul>
   <i>14-Nov-2008</i>&nbsp;EventBus 1.3b Released. EventBus 1.3b adds:
   <li><i>21-Aug-2008</i>&nbsp;EventBus 1.2 Released. EventBus 1.2 delivers significant new features:
      <ul>
         <li>@EventSubscriber and @EventTopicSubscriber annotations take the boilerplate out EventBus
            coding.
         </li>
         <li>Configurable EventBus implementation for support of non-Swing applications.</li>
         <li>Generics support - subscribing to List&lt;Trade&gt;, for example, and Subscribers take generic
            types for typesafe coding.
         </li>
         <li>Improved logging which can leverage log4j, java.util.logging, and commons-logging.</li>
         <li>Even better documentation.</li>
      </ul>
   </li>
   <li><i>18-Jan-2008</i>&nbsp;EventBus is being used by Wellfleet Software for an implementation of ebXML
   Registry and Repository 4.0 specifications.
   <p>According to Farrukh Najmi, the lead architect for the project: </p>

   <p>"EventBus has been a tremendous improvement over tradition Swing PropertyChangeListener /
      firePropertyChangeEvent API.
      The biggest benefit of EventBus is that the resulting design is very loosely coupled. We found that
      EventBus was simple to
      use with minimal learning curve, had a small footprint and of a very high quality. We even plan to
      use it in non-Swing,
      server-based GUIs."</p>
   <li><i>30-Nov-2007</i>&nbsp;ZD Net has published <a
        href="http://www.zdnetasia.com/techguide/java/0,39044898,62034699,00.htm">this article</a> on the
   EventBus.
   <li><i>27-Nov-2007</i>&nbsp;EventBus 1.2 beta released. The 1.2 beta release provides flexible logging - give it a
      whirl in your app and please send feedback. You don't need anything but EventBus.jar, but if you want to use log4j
      or any other logger support by Apache Commons Logging, then include the common-logging-* jars and
      the jar of the logger of your choice (such as log4j, conveniently included in the release folder). Logging is a
      great way to debug event issues which are often hard to track down due to their decoupled nature. The EventBus
      provides lots of DEBUG output so you can see who is subscribed to what.
   </li>
   <li><i>11-Nov-2007</i>&nbsp;EventBus 1.1 released. <b>Important:</b> All users of 1.0 should upgrade to version 1.1,
      which contains a Swing threading bug fix and production Annotation implementation. If you are using release 1.0
      for JDK 1.4, upgrade to 1.0.1 for JDK 1.4 (below).
   </li>
   <li><i>6-Sept-2007</i>&nbsp;The Event Bus has released 1.1 beta2, adding generics support and fixing an Annotation
      issues. This is a solid beta, though some of the generics APIs are not yet complete (vetos, unsubscribes).
   </li>
   <li><i>29-Apr-2007</i>&nbsp;The Event Bus has released 1.1 beta featuring subscription Annotations and a customizable
      EventBus implementation.
   </li>
   <li><i>18-Mar-2007</i>&nbsp;Will the EventBus find life in outer space? (Now there's a "Watch the News at 10"
      headline!)
      <a href="http://kepler.nasa.gov/">NASA's Kepler Mission</a> is using the EventBus in software
      that analyses hundreds of thousands of stars for planets that may support life.
   </li>
   <li><i>27-Dec-2006</i>&nbsp;The Event Bus has released an alpha 1.1 alpha version with Annotations!</li>
   <li><i>26-Nov-2006</i>&nbsp;The Event Bus has reached version 1.0! With the recently added caching feature (thanks to
      Hans Muller for the inspiration),
      and the removal of the EventServiceEvent dependency (any object can be published now), the EventBus is now feature
      complete
      for the 1.0 release. The 1.0 release will be the last release for JDK 1.4. Work will now begin on Annotations and
      Generics,
      which of course will require 1.5. Further 1.4 work, such as bug fixes will be done on the JDK_14 branch.
   </li>
   <li><i>22-Nov-2006</i>&nbsp;Martin Fowler has published <a
           href="http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventCollaboration.html">an EventBus-like pattern he calls
      EventCollaboration</a> .
   </li>
   <li><i>20-July-2006</i>&nbsp;Evan Summers has published an <a
           href="https://aptframework.dev.java.net/article/edtMessageBus.html">article</a> showing a similar EventBus
      implementation with some nice annotations.

<h2>About the EventBus</h2>

<p> The Event Bus is a single-process publish/subscribe event routing library, with Swing extensions.
The EventBus is fully-functional, with very good API documentation and test coverage (80+%). It has been deployed
in many production environments, including financial, engineering and scientific applications.
<p>The Event Bus is easy to use and yet very powerful. It requires no
setup and the API is small and clear. The EventBus solves many problems,
and promotes loose coupling, particularly with Swing applications.
<p>The <a href="HopOnTheEventBus-Web.ppt">slides from the EventBus presentation at JavaOne 2006</a>
   demonstrate many ways to use the EventBus.

<p>Though not Swing-specific, the EventBus has Swing support and the
EventBus hopes to make Swing applications more componentized, modular
and testable. The EventBus has its conceptual roots in the <a
        href="http://java.sun.com/products/archive/javabeans/infobus/downloads.html">old
   InfoBus from JDK 1.1 days</a>, but it is much simpler and smaller.
The idea is similar to a computer system bus - components plug into
a single bus and each can listen for information passed on it. The EventBus is different from
the tightly-coupled Swing listener paradigm where listeners attach to and listen on
specific components. Another difference is that the EventBus is not limited to Swing events.
Any object can be published on the EventBus. In typically usage, you create events for your own applications,
or publish objects that you already have in your application domain.
<p>Components can subscribe to events passed on the Event Bus by Class or by String (called a topic name).
Subscriptions use weak references by default, avoiding memory leaks common in swing application when
listeners are not removed.
<p>The Event Bus is related to messaging systems
like JMS whereby many processes publish messages on a topic and other systems
can listen on the topic. JMS implementations take care of efficiently
routing the messages. The major advantage to JMS and the EventBus
is that it introduces a decoupling layer. Components only have to
know about the bus, not each subscriber and publisher that they may
be interested in. The EventBus differs from JMS since it meant to be used by a single JVM.

<h3>Production Release</h3>

<p>The stable release is 1.3. This release works with JDK 1.5 and later.
<p><a href="https://eventbus.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectDocumentList?folderID=11427">1.3 Stable Release Folder</a>

<h2>JavaDoc</h2>

<p>EventBus documentation is quite good and is available as download as well as <a href="doc/api/overview-summary.html">online</a>.
   Please see the library and package descriptions for a list of features and examples in addition to those supplied here.</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p> A typical use case for the EventBus is a status bar. Applications can avoid coupling
components to status bars (and vice versa) by publishing status events on the EventBus
and having the status bar subscribe to status events. (A key advantage of the EventBus is that the
contracts between components are defined by the events that are published between them.) :
<p>StatusEvent.java
          <pre>public StatusEvent { 
   Sting statusText;
   
   public StatusEvent(String statusText) { 
      this.statusText = statusText;
   }
   public String getStatusText() {
      return statusText;
   }
}</pre>
<p>AnySwingController.java </p>
          <pre>...   
EventBus.publish(new StatusEvent(&quot;Looking up data...&quot;));</pre>
<p>StatusBar.java
          <pre>public StatusBar extends JLabel implements EventSubscriber {
   public StatusBar() {
      EventBus.subscribe(StatusEvent.class, this);
   }
   public void onEvent(Object evt) {
      StatusEvent statusEvent = (StatusEvent)evt;
	  this.setText(statusEvent.getStatusText();
   }
   }

}
</pre>
<p>
With Annotations, it's a bit simpler (StatusEvent.java and AnySwingController.java stay the same):
<p>StatusBar.java
      <pre>public StatusBar extends JLabel {
              public StatusBar() {
                 AnnotationProcessor.process(this);
              }
              @EventSubscriber(eventClass=StatusEvent.class)
              public void onEvent(StatusEvent statusEvent) {
                 this.setText(statusEvent.getStatusText();
              }
           }
      </pre>
